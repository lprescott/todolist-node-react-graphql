## react.js 
is a front-end, open-source JavaScript library used to make developing user interfaces easier. React excels at displaying and updating data-driven components - that is, bits of your webpage that display data or rely on data. This is great for elements like charts, data tables, or any websites that display lots of changing data - for example, Facebook, Twitter, or Hackterms. React can be very fast, but is also weighty and, like any framework, can be hard to fully understand, since it abstracts away what its doing. Common alternatives are other front-end frameworks and libraries like Vue.js and AngularJS.

## Node.js 
is a Javascript runtime environment that allows you to run (and code with) the Javascript language outside of the browser (which traditionally shipped with JS support) - for example, on the server. Node.js forms the foundation for JS backends such as Express, Koa, Hapi, Backbone, Sails.js, and many others. It's also possible to define a server with Node without the use of these back-end frameworks.

### Apollo
is a community-maintained open-source GraphQL server. It works with pretty much all Node.js HTTP server frameworks! Apollo Server works with any GraphQL schema built with GraphQL.js--so you may build your schema with that or a convenience library such as graphql-tools.

## GraphQL
a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## PostgreSQL
often simply Postgres, is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). It is a free and open source, ACID-compliant and transactional database management system.
